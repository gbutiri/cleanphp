Problem:
Build website for user.

Why did I write this code?
Too many times I've been given the task to start a new project that usually requires 
some sort of user authentication. I thought, why not build a framework around it? Why 
not just install and run with it?

Why not use 3rd party frameworks?
3rd party frameworks have their own language to learn. It usually takes months to master
them. Not just install and run, but master... And, by the time you're done mastering it,
version 2 comes out. Or version 1 is no longer supported. 3rd party frameworks are 
bulky, require dependencies (composer, propel, caching, etc). My solution is something 
that only depends on some sort of a quick LAMP environment. And that's it.

Solution:
Well, I created a framework that's ready out of the box, and evolves as PHP evolves. No
more constraints. 

Why am I having multiple steps to install?
1. These steps only require to run one time. I don't want to clog up the code base with
code that will only run once
2. One day, I shall have an install file like wordpress. Until then, configure to your 
heart's content. It's not that hard. Do the work, you lazy bums!

Update 1 (10/8/14):
I did add the install.php file which will delete itself upon successful completion. 
Still make sure you have a databse. 

------------------ SEE CONFIG FILE FIRST!!! ------------------ 

I also added user token / salt authenticaion. The salt does nothing yet, but I will make 
it do something soon enough.Right now it just checks against a login token that gets set 
everytime a user properly logs in. If you try to check a logged in page from a different 
machine / browser, you will be logged out.

Pre Settings:
You will need WAMP, MAMP, XAMP or some sort of a LAMP environment.

Steps to installation.

1. copy the config sample to config.php and modify accordingly. (DO NOT ADD TO GIT)

2. required apache modules:
rewrite_module
expires_module
headers_module
filter_module

3. create database:
dbname or whatever is in the config file

4. Enable mysqli for databases

5. Create Cache Folders (DO NOT ADD TO GIT):
/cache/
/cache/combine

These are for the combination of the css and js files. Groupring them into single http 
requests is awesome.

** The benefits **
- less than a second to clone.
- quick development turnaround time.
- easy to understand code.
- funnel control opened wide at both ends.
- no confusing new languages to learn. Simple.

** The features **
- ajax controller
- general functions
  - getDataURI => convert any image into data-uri
  - friendlyURL => turn any text into a friendly URL (regex)
  - birthday => a check that returns the differnce in years for a date (birthday 
    checks)
  - get_days => a function to get number of days between now and a specified date.
  - checkEmail => check email format on server side.
  - checkPassword => check password requirements. Too long, too short, not enough 
    special characters, etc.
  - checkUsername => similar to checkPassword, but for usernames.
  - checkValidDate => check to see if the specified date is valid.
  - createRandomPassword => if you want to generate a random alpha numeric string.
  - makeUserFolder => in case you have to create some nested folders for your users.
  - cacheModule => turn an "include" file into an html cached module. Using file 
    caching for exceptions. i.e. A static form on a page.
  - cacheDynamicModule => same as above, but works with dynamic paths (user profile 
    cached).
  - burstCache => Clears both of the above stored files.
  - makeIfNoExist => recursively create a folder if it does not exist. (Kind of like 
    makeUserFolder)
  - resizeAttachment => resize images based on some parameters. Resizing to fill in and
    cropping horizontally as well as vertically.
  - getZipInfo => using google map api to get location information (city state lat 
    long)
  - getLatLong => same as above (only get lat long). Could be combined I suppose.
- modular SPA design
- root folder single pages easy to spot
- sql-core that runs mysqli prepared statements for ease of use
  - example query call:
  - $sql = "SELECT id, fname, lname FROM users WHERE username LIKE ?";
  - $users = sqlGet( $sql, 's', array( trim( $_POST['username'] ) ) );
  - echo "User's first name is: " . $users[0]['fname'];
- No confusing new languages to learn. Simple.
