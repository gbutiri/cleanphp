Why am I having multiple steps to install?
1. These steps only require tu run one time. I don't want to clog up the code base with code that will only run once
2. One day, I shall have an install file like wordpress. Until then, configure to your heart's content. It's not that hard. Do the work, you lazy bums!

Steps to installation.

1. copy the config sample to config.php and modify accordingly. (DO NOT ADD TO GIT)

2. required apache modules:
rewrite_module
expires_module
headers_module
filter_module

3. create database:
dbname or whatever is in the config file

4. Create Cache Folders (DO NOT ADD TO GIT):
/cache/
/cache/combine
